# GaussNetworks
Implementation of Gauss networks: training, attack and additional analyses. If you want to get started, you can download the notebooks for training and attacking. The notebooks contain code to download the repository and the trained models. Hence, you don't have to do anything than running the notebooks (if you have standard libraries such as numpy and pytorch installed). For example, you can run the notebooks without any further ado in Google colab.
